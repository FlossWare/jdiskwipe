## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to professional and respectful collaboration. Please:
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions
- Focus on the technical merits of contributions
- Help maintain a welcoming environment for all contributors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher** - Required for compilation
- **Apache Maven 3.6+** - Required for building and testing
- **Git** - For version control
- A Java IDE (recommended: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions)

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/jdiskwipe.git
   cd jdiskwipe
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/FlossWare/jdiskwipe.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Building the Project

Build the project to ensure your environment is set up correctly:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will:
- Compile all source code
- Run the full test suite
- Generate the executable JAR at `target/jdiskwipe-1.0.jar`

### Running Tests

Run the test suite:

```bash
mvn test
```

Run tests with coverage report:

```bash
mvn clean test jacoco:report
```

View coverage at `target/site/jacoco/index.html`

### Generating Documentation

Generate JavaDoc:

```bash
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

View docs at `target/site/apidocs/index.html`

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

Follow these conventions consistently throughout the codebase:

#### General Guidelines
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line Length**: Max 120 characters (prefer 100)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **File Format**: Unix line endings (LF)

#### Java Conventions
- **Naming**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `FileWorker`, `CleanDisk`)
  - Methods/Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `formatBytes`, `bufferSize`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`, `PREFIX`)
  - Package: lowercase (e.g., `org.flossware.jdiskwipe.disk`)

- **Visibility**:
  - Use package-private (no modifier) for internal classes
  - Use `private` for implementation details
  - Only expose `public` APIs when necessary
  - Document all public APIs with JavaDoc

- **Braces**:
  - Always use braces for `if`, `for`, `while`, even for single statements
  - Opening brace on same line as statement
  - Closing brace on new line

#### Example Code Style

```java
/**
 * Performs an important operation.
 *
 * @param input the input value
 * @return the result
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if input is null
 */
public int doSomething(final String input) {
    if (input == null) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Input cannot be null");
    }
    
    final int result = process(input);
    return result;
}
```

### JavaDoc Requirements

- **All public classes and methods** must have JavaDoc
- Include:
  - Summary sentence (first sentence is critical)
  - `@param` tags for all parameters
  - `@return` tag for non-void methods
  - `@throws` tags for declared exceptions
- Keep JavaDoc concise but complete
- Focus on *what* and *why*, not *how* (code shows the how)

### Copyright Headers

All Java files must include the GPL copyright header:

```java

 * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

- **New features**: Require comprehensive test coverage (aim for 80%+ line coverage)
- **Bug fixes**: Add a test that reproduces the bug, then fix it
- **Refactoring**: Ensure existing tests pass; add new tests for changed behavior

### Test Structure

- Use **JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5)** for all tests
- Place tests in `src/test/java` mirroring the source structure
- Test class naming: `[ClassUnderTest]Test.java`
- Test method naming: `test[MethodName][Condition]` (e.g., `testConstructorWithNullDirectory`)

### Test Guidelines

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on other tests
2. **Cleanup**: Use `@TempDir` for file operations to ensure automatic cleanup
3. **Assertions**: Use clear assertion messages
4. **Edge Cases**: Test null inputs, empty values, boundary conditions, and invalid states
5. **Thread Safety**: Test concurrent operations where applicable

### Example Test

```java
@Test
void testConstructorWithNullDirectory() {
    assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, 
        () -> new FileWorker(null, 1024),
        "Constructor should reject null directory");
}

@Test
void testFileCreation(@TempDir final Path tempDir) {
    final FileWorker worker = new FileWorker(tempDir.toFile(), 512);
    assertNotNull(worker, "Worker should be created successfully");
}
```

### Running Tests Locally

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

```bash
# All tests pass
mvn clean test

# No JavaDoc warnings
mvn javadoc:javadoc

# Project builds successfully
mvn clean package
```

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Strategy

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Use descriptive branch names:
   - `feature/add-multi-pass-wipe` - New features
   - `fix/thread-cleanup-issue` - Bug fixes
   - `docs/improve-usage-guide` - Documentation updates
   - `refactor/simplify-validation` - Code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

**Format:**
```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

Detailed explanation of what changed and why, if necessary.
Include relevant context, references to issues, etc.

Fixes #123
```

**Good commit messages:**
- `Add support for custom wipe patterns`
- `Fix thread interrupt handling in FileWorker`
- `Update README with Windows-specific instructions`

**Bad commit messages:**
- `fix bug`
- `changes`
- `wip`
